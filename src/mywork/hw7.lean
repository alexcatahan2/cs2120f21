Define relation, r, as two-place predicate on 
a type, β, with notation, x ≺ y, for (r x y). 
-/
variables {α β : Type}  (r : β → β → Prop)
local infix `≺`:50 := r  
-- Strangely Lean's library does define asymmetric, so here it is.
def asymmetric := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, x ≺ y → ¬ y ≺ x



-- Prove both formally and in English.
example : (∃ (x y : β), r x y) → asymmetric r → ¬reflexive r :=
begin
  assume h,
  cases h with w pf,
  unfold asymmetric,
  unfold reflexive,
  assume h,
  assume j,
  have a := j w,
  have b := h a,
  contradiction,
end
/-
To prove that if a relation is assymteric then the relation is also
not reflexive we first have to assume that there exist a x of β type
in the relation, becaue this propisition is not true over an empty set.
If the relation is assymetric than the pair of beta types are only 
related one way, so they cannot possible be equal, or reflexive.

Logic, like programming, is subtle. It's very easy for humans
to miss subtle corner cases. As an example, today I ran across
a problem in a textbook by Paul Traiger, a professor emeritus
of philosophy and cognitive science at Occidental College. He
asks students to prove that if a relation is both transitive and 
reflexive that it cannot be anti-symmetric. Is it actually true?
If not, what condition needs to be added to make it true? See
https://sites.oxy.edu/traiger/logic/exercises/chapter13/properties_of_relations_exercise.html

example : (∃ (b : β), true) → transitive r → reflexive r → ¬ asymmetric r :=
begin
  unfold transitive reflexive asymmetric,
  assume h,
  assume trans,
  assume refl,
  assume asymm,
  cases h with w pf,
  have r_w_w := refl w,
  have notr_w_w := asymm r_w_w,
  contradiction,
end

State and prove that the subset relation on the powerset of any
set, s, is antisymmetric. Formally state and prove, and then give
an informal proof, of this proposition. You may use the following
formal definition of the powerset of a given set, s. 
-/

def powerset (s : set β) := { s' | s' ⊆ s}

example : ∀ (s : set β) 
            (s1 s2 ∈ powerset s), 
            s1 ⊆ s2 → 
            s2 ⊆ s1 → 
            s1 = s2 :=
begin
  assume s s1 s2,
  assume s1ins s2ins,
  assume s1s2 s2s1,
  apply set.ext,
  assume x,
  split,
  assume xs1,
  have xins2 := s1s2 xs1,
  apply xins2,

end

Given two natural numbers, n and m, we will say that m divides n
if there is a natural number, k, such that n = k*m. Here's a formal
definition of this relation.
-/

def divides (m n : ℕ) := ∃ k, n = k * m

/- 
#3: Formally state and prove each of the following propositions.
Remember that the ring tactic is useful for producing proofs of
algebraic equalities involving + and *. You can use the phrase,
"by basic algebra" when translating the use of this tactic into
English.

-- 3a: For any n, 1 divides n.

example : ∀ n, divides 1 n :=
begin
  assume n, 
  unfold divides,
  cases n,
  apply exists.intro 0,
  refl,
  apply exists.intro 1,
  
  
  
end

-- 3b. For any n, n divides n

example : ∀ n, divides n n :=
begin
end

-- #3c. divides is reflexive (use our reflexive predicate)

example : reflexive divides :=
begin
end 

-- #3d. divides is transitive

example : ∀ h n k, divides h n → divides n k → divides h k :=
begin
end 

/- 
#3d. is divides symmetric? if yes, give a proof, otherwise 
give a counterexample and a brief explanation to show that 
it's not.

-- Answer here

/- 
#3e. Prove that divides is antisymmetric. Use the
anti_symmetric predicate to state the proposition
formally.
-/
example : relations.anti_symmetric divides := 
begin
  unfold relations.anti_symmetric divides,
  assume x y kx ky,
  cases kx with kxv kxpf,
  cases ky with kyv kypf,
  rw kxpf at kypf,
  /-
  From kypf we can deduce by basic algebra
  that kyv = kxv = 1, and the rewriting kxv
  as 1 in kxpf, we get that y = x. The proof
  of the conclusion then follows by symmetry
  of equality. We don't yet quite have the
  tools to reason formally to the conlusion
  that kxv and kyv are both one, so we'll 
  just admit it as an axiom for now, using
  sorry to remind us to come back and visit
  this point again when we're equipped to 
  polish off the formal proof.
