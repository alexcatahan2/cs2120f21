Algebraic structure:
- collection of values
- collection of applicable operations

Examples:
- int, +
- int, +, *
- string, ++
- bool, &&, ! (and, not)
-/
--set of objects, and then operations on that set
--(carrier set), (set of operations on the values of carrier set)
/-
We now introduce the algebraic structure
that we call the set, by explaining what
are the objects of this type and what are
the applicable operations.
-/

--a set is a collection of objects of some kind, and those
--are the objects of our algebraic structure

/-
operations on sets:
  -union
  -complement
  -empty
  -complete
  -intersection
  -power set : the set of all possible subsets
  -subset : that every element in the first set is also in the second set, if V is a memeber of S prime, than V is a member of S
  -membership: given a set, given a value, you get back some sense whether that value is in that set or not
  -product: set of all possible pairs of sets

-/

/-
Power Set:
{1,2,3} -type nat
{1,2}, {2,3}, {1, 3} -type set(nat)
{1}, {2}, {3} -type set(nat)
{} - empty set of elements of some type, in this case nat
{1, 2, 3}

TYPE OF A POWER SET IS SET OF SET OF NAT set(set(nat))

when you add one element to a set you double the size of the power set
the size of the power set is 2^n: set of the power set of a set of size n

/-
Product set:
1 = {nice, mean} 2 = {cat dog}
{(nice, cat), (nice, dog), (mean, cat), (mean, dog)}

the size of a proudct set is the product of the size of the two sets

{1, 2, 3, 4} : this is called display notation

{n : N | n % 2 = 0} - using a predicate to distinguish wheteher

                      by a predicate, the type of the predict in

russels paradox: consider the set of all sets that don't contain 
themselves lets call that set S. S is the set of all set's that
don't contain itself. 
-/

/-
sets can't contain itself b/c a set of type T objects
can't hold a set of type set T inside
-/

/- OBJECTS 

The objects of this algebraic structure are 
values of type "set T," where T is the type
of objects "in" the set: of the "members" of 
the set. 

For example, consider the set, written in 
what's caledl display notation: { 1, 2, 3, 4 }.
The set has four members, as enumerated here.
The key distinction we want to make is between
the type of the elements, here ℕ, and the type
of the set, here, set ℕ.

Lean in fact supports this notation. A little
later in the lecture, we'll figure out what it
actually means. Then you'll see the power that
comes with the corresponding epiphany. 
-/

/- OPERATIONS

Assume that we've been given some type, T. The 
operations of the "set T" algebraic structure
include the following:

empty set -- containing no elements of type T
complete set -- containing all T-valued elts
membership (s : set T) (val : T) : is member?
complement (s : set T) : set T  -- not in s
union (s1 s2 : set T) : set T   -- in either
intersection (s1 s2 : set T) : set T -- in both
product (s1 : set T) (s2 : set V) : set (T × V)
power (s : set T) : set (set T) -- set of subsets
-/

/- CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE!

You might visualize a set as being a
collection of objects (such as natural
numbers, for example). But let's make 
a fundamental shift in perspective, one
that builds on everything we've learned
so far.

We will now think of a set defined by
the property that distinguishes objects
that are in the set from those that are
not. 
-/

def s1 : set ℕ := { n : ℕ | n = 0 }

#check s1
#reduce s1
#check λ (n : ℕ), n = 0

def s1' : ℕ → Prop := { n : ℕ | n = 0 }


#check s1 0
#reduce s1' 0
#reduce s1 1
#reduce s1 2
#reduce s1' 3

/-
Let's meet up once again with our favorite
one-place predicate on the natural numbers.
-/

def ev (n : ℕ) : Prop := n % 2 = 0

/-
In a sense that we can now make precise,
this *predicate* defines a set: the set 
of all natural numbers that *satisfy* it. 
We can think of ev as being a membership
predicate that indicates whether a given
value is in a given set or not. 

It should be clear that every predicate
defines a set, and perhaps that there is
a predicate for every set. 

The next section of the course introduces
the lovely topic of set theory based exactly
on this idea: represent sets as predicates,
and operations on sets (such as intersection
and union) as corresponding to operations on 
predicates. 

Indeed we will define the type "set T" just
to be the predicate T → Prop! A set is thus
represented *exactly* as a predicate in our
logic.

/- #1: 
Represent the empty set using set comprehension. 

Here's the empty set (of natural numbers) 
in display notation. Write the same set using 
set comprehension notation.

numbers using set comprehension notation.

/-
What we see is that we can represent a 
given set with the right predicate in a
set comprehension expression. Now let's
think about having two sets, with two 
characteristic predicates, P and Q. We
will continue to assume these operate on
natural numbers, but the argument type
could be anything.
